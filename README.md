Project Boost (Assigment 3 Unity C# GameDev course)

This is a game in which you control a UFO to navigate your way through oscillating obstacles. 

My version of the game can be found playable on: [https://kloppenburg.me/projectboost/](https://kloppenburg.me/projectboost/)
Use WASD or arrows as controls. You start from a blue and need to end up on the green one. If you hit any object, your progress will be reset.
